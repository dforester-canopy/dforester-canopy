## ðŸŒ² Hi, Iâ€™m Desmond

Iâ€™m a forester and PhD researcher at the University of Cambridge, passionate about understanding forest structure and canopy architecture. My work explores how forest canopies interact with the atmosphere, using tools like LiDAR, remote sensing, and field-based ecological measurements to visualize better and analyze complex forest systems.

ðŸ”¬ On this GitHub, youâ€™ll find projects related to:
- Forest structural modelling
- Ecohydrological interactions
- Spatial data visualization & analysis
- Research tools and workflows in Python/R

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate to make forests more visible, measurable, and understood ðŸŒ³
